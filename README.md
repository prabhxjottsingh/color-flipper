# Color Flipper

This is a basic color flipper project, which I have made using: ```HTML``` , ```CSS``` and ```Javascript```, for the basic understanding of the JS.

It basically changes the color of the background to any other random color, whenever you click the ```Click Me``` button.

```Color-Flipper``` is basically limited to 4 colors only (built for learning).

```Hex Flipper``` is the final project, you can view the project at the link given below.

You can have a look at the live project <a href = "https://prabhxjottsingh.github.io/color-flipper/"> here </a>.

Got the basic knowledge of the following few features of the ```JS``` from the above project:
1. ```addEventListener```
2. ```document.getElementById```
3. ```document.querySelector```
4. ```.innerHTML```
5. ```document.body.style.backgroundColor```
